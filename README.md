A11Y notes:
I added hidden text to inform that the for the hame page Font Awesome arrow links to the portfolio page. And I added a hidden text description for the copyright icon. I set up a skip link on the portfolio and about pages so the user can skip the header navigation and go straight to the main contend. I also added hidden text (with sr-only class) to indicate that links for portfolio items will open in a new tabs. I changed from div tags to use nav tags so the screen reader would recognize it as navigation links.
